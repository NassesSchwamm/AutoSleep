AutoSleep lets you toggle automatic sleeping while standing in a bed. It is intended to use for afk farms, which only work during a specific time of day (like gnome farms), but you can do whatever you want with this mod.

How it works:
- Press the Auto Sleep keybind (default: Z) while touching a bed to toggle the sleep loop.
- The loop will only sleep when you are within close proximity to the bed and are within the configured sleep hours.
- When sleep hours end, you wake up automatically.
- The loop can optionally stop itself on specific conditions (death, config disabled, invalid sleep window, leaving the bed hitbox).

Config (client-side):
- Enable/disable the mod
- Enable/disable chat messages
- Sleep start/end time as text (HH:MM recommended; also accepts decimal hours or total minutes) -- (NO AM / PM SUPPORT!! -- use millitary (european) time)
- Stop loop on death
- Stop loop when config is disabled
- Stop loop on invalid sleep window
- Stop loop on leaving the bed hitbox
- Stop loop outside window (control whether stop conditions apply while outside sleep hours)

Notes:
- Client-side only
