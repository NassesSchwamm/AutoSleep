[h1]AutoSleep[/h1]
AutoSleep lets you toggle automatic sleeping while standing in a bed. It is intended to use for afk farms, which only work during a specific time of day (like gnome farms), but you can do whatever you want with this mod.

[b]How it works[/b]
[list]
[*]Press the Auto Sleep keybind (default: Z) while touching a bed to toggle the sleep loop.
[*]The loop will only sleep when you are within close proximity to the bed and are within the configured sleep hours.
[*]When sleep hours end, you wake up automatically.
[*]The loop can optionally stop itself on specific conditions (death, config disabled, invalid sleep window, leaving the bed hitbox).

[b]Config[/b]
[list]
[*]Enable/disable the mod
[*]Enable/disable chat messages
[*]Sleep start/end time as text (HH:MM recommended; also accepts decimal hours or total minutes) -- (NO AM / PM SUPPORT!! -- use millitary (european) time)
[*]Stop loop on death
[*]Stop loop when config is disabled
[*]Stop loop on invalid sleep window
[*]Stop loop on leaving the bed hitbox
[*]Stop loop outside window (control whether stop conditions apply while outside sleep hours)
